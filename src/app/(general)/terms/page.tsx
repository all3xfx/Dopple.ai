          action waiver. By agreeing to these Terms, you consent (a) to settle
          all disputes through binding individual arbitration, meaning that you
          relinquish any right to have those disputes resolved by a judge or
          jury, and (b) to forego your right to participate in class actions,
          class arbitrations, or representative actions. The option to opt-out
          of arbitration is detailed further in these Terms.

          enforce these Terms; (c) respond to claims that any content violates
          the rights of third parties; or (d) protect the rights, property, or

          <br />
          Copyright Complaints. Dopple Labs respects the intellectual property
          of others, and we ask our users to do the same. If you believe that
          your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright

          Counter-Notice: If you think your User Content was wrongly removed or

          copyright owner, its agent, or the law to upload and use this content,

          Agent gets your counter-notice, Dopple Labs will send a copy to the
          original complainant, letting them know that they may replace the
          removed content or stop disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the
          copyright owner seeks a court order against the content provider,

          releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor

          would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor

          Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration
        </span>
        <span className={cn("text-black9")}>
          This section affects your rights so please read it carefully.
        </span>
        <span className={cn("text-[16px] font-medium")}>
          Agreement to Arbitrate
        </span>
        <span className={cn("text-black9")}>
          This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section of the Terms is
          referred to in these Terms as the “Arbitration Agreement.” You agree
          that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise
          between you and Dopple Labs, whether arising out of or relating to
          these Terms (including any alleged breach thereof), the Website or
          Services, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us,
          shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration,
          rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration
          Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small
          claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration
          Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention
          of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the
          law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by
          entering into these Terms, you and Dopple Labs are each waiving the
          right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your
          rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or
          jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
          enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
        </span>
        <span className={cn("text-[16px] font-medium")}>
          Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized
          Relief
        </span>
        <span className={cn("text-black9")}>
          You and Dopple Labs agree that each of us may bring claims against the
          other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class
          member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding.
          Unless both You and Dopple Labs agree otherwise, the arbitrator may
          not consolidate or join more than one person’s or party’s claims and
          may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated,
          representative, or class proceeding. Also, the arbitrator may award
          relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only
          in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
          necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual
          claim(s).

          Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution
        </span>
        <span className={cn("text-black9")}>
          Dopple Labs is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and
          fairly, and so if you have concerns, we strongly encourage you to
          first email us about them at support@Dopple.ai. If such efforts prove
          unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send
          to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute
          (“Notice”). The Notice to Dopple Labs should be sent to Dopple Labs
          Inc. 251 Little Falls Dr., Wilmington, DE 19808 (“Notice Address”).
          The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or
          dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Dopple Labs
          and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after
          the Notice is received, you or Dopple Labs may commence an arbitration
          proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer
          made by Dopple Labs or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator
          until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you
          or Dopple Labs is entitled.

          Arbitration Procedures
        </span>
        <span className={cn("text-black9")}>
          Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance
          with JAMS’ (“JAMS”) Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures
          (collectively, the “JAMS Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration
          Agreement. For information on JAMS, please visit its website,
          https://www.jamsadr.com/. If there is any inconsistency between any
          term of the JAMS Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the
          applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the
          arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent
          Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair
          arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these
          Terms as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide,
          including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope,
          enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.
          Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more
          streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator
          can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a
          court can award to an individual under the Terms and applicable law.
          Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be
          overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
          <br />
          Unless Dopple Labs and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings
          will take place in Miami, FL. If the parties are unable to agree on a
          location, the determination shall be made by JAMS. If your claim is
          for $10,000 or less, Dopple Labs agrees that you may choose whether
          the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents
          submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic or video conference
          hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the JAMS Rules.
          If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be
          determined by the JAMS Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the
          arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned
          written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and
          conclusions on which the award is based.

        <span className={cn("text-[16px] font-medium")}>
          Costs of Arbitration
        </span>
        <span className={cn("text-black9")}>
          Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees
          (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the JAMS
          Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.
        </span>
        <span className={cn("text-[16px] font-medium")}>Confidentiality</span>
        <span className={cn("text-black9")}>
          All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision,
          or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the
          benefit of all parties.
        </span>
        <span className={cn("text-[16px] font-medium")}>Severability</span>
        <span className={cn("text-black9")}>
          If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of
          this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled
          “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and
          Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the
          parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or
          provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
          expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
          provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so
          modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the
          provisions of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and
          Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or
          unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall
          be null and void. The remainder of the Terms will continue to apply.

          Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement
        </span>
        <span className={cn("text-black9")}>
          Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Use to the contrary,
          Dopple Labs agrees that if it makes any future change to this
          Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address)
          while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change
          by sending Dopple Labs written notice within thirty (30) calendar days
          of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any
          future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute
          between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration
          Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted
          any subsequent changes to these Terms).
        </span>
        <span className={cn("text-[20px] font-semibold")}>Termination</span>
        <span className={cn("text-black9")}>
          You agree that Dopple Labs, in its sole discretion, may suspend or
          terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Services
          and remove and discard any content within the Website or Services, for
          any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if
          Dopple Labs believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently
          with the letter or spirit of these Terms or Dopple Labs’s Acceptable
          Use Policy. Dopple Labs may also in its sole discretion and at any
          time discontinue providing the Services, or any part thereof, with or
          without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the
          Services under any provision of these Terms or our AUP may be effected
          without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Dopple Labs may
          (but has no obligation to) immediately deactivate or delete your
          account and all related information and files in your account and/or
          bar any further access to such files or the Services. Termination of
          your account or access to any component of the Services will not
          terminate Dopple Labs’s rights to your User Content. Further, you
          agree that Dopple Labs will not be liable to you or any third party
          for any termination of your access to the Services.
        </span>
        <span className={cn("text-[20px] font-semibold")}>General</span>
        <span className={cn("text-black9")}>
          Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between
          you and Dopple Labs and govern your use of our Services, superseding
          any prior agreements between you and Dopple Labs with respect to the
          Services.
          <br />
          Choice of Law, Jurisdiction, Venue. These Terms are governed by the
          laws of the State of Florida without regard to its conflict of law
          provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to
          arbitration, as set forth above, you and Dopple Labs agree to submit
          to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal
          courts located within Miami-Dade County, Florida.
          <br />
          Severance. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of
          competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree
          that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’
          intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of
          these Terms remain in full force and effect.
          <br />
          No Waiver. Any failure of Dopple Labs to exercise or enforce any right
          or provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of such right
          or provision.
          <br />
          Expiration of Claims. You agree that regardless of any statute or law
          to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or
          related to use of the Site or these Terms of Use must be filed within
          one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever
          barred.
          <br />
          Admissibility. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice
          given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or
          administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to
          the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business
          documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed
          form.
          <br />
          Assignment. You may not assign these Terms without the prior written
          consent of Dopple Labs, but Dopple Labs may assign or transfer these
          Terms of Use, in whole or in part, without restriction.
          <br />
          Section Headings. The section titles in these Terms of Use are for
          convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
          <br />
          Notice. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail.
          The Site may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms or
          other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on

          reasons, which will come into immediate effect. If you continue to use
          the Site subsequent to the activation of any such changes, it
